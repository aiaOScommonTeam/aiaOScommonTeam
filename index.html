                    <h2>What is aiaOS?</h2>
                    aiaOS is an terminal-based OS simulator that was made 4 fun. <br>
                    aiaOS for now is in the prealpha and is only available in the insider program.
                    <h2>What platform is it for?</h2>
                    At the moment it's only available on Android and I don't think it'll be available on any other platform.
                    <h2>How to get access to the aiaOS?</h2>
                    That's simple. You have to fill that form below: <br>
                    <a href="https://forms.gle/xw7qsUjnwdcBsYYR9">that form below</a> <br>
                    <h2>When will be the full release?</h2>
                    Honestly I don't know.
